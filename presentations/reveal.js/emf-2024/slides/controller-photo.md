## Not a timing device

Notes:

I hot-glued the lights to the hat, turning in a random(ish) direction after I'd glued-down each one, attempting to move towards empty space each time. I also managed to stick 2 or 3 of them on backwards because I'm an idiot, and of course by the time I was done there were little wisps of hot-glue all round the room, a common experience for many of us, I'm sure, during EMF season.

I will one day get rich and famous when I invent a hot-glue gun that doesn't do this.

I cable-tied the Pi to the power-bank and wired everything up, producing this device, which you absolutely would not want to try to take through an airport
