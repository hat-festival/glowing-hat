## Mapping the lights

Notes:

So this is where the interesting stuff starts: we need to take 400 very precise photos of the hat. First we need some method of mounting the hat and the camera a fixed distance apart and absolutely square-on to each other. Did I use Lego? Of course I used Lego.

So we build a little rig, and than once everything is securely mounted, in a reasonably dark room, we just run a script that lights the pixels, one at a time, and takes a photo. Once we've got our 100 photos from the front, we turn the hat through 90 degrees, and take 100 more photos. And then again, and again, for all four sides.
