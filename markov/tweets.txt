In order to maintain the national buzz, the finale of the Closing Ceremony will feature Piers Morgan being smacked repeatedly with a bat
Hey if you ever call me again, I'm gonna find out where you live
Heard this on Radio 2 this morning for the first time in ages:
I've just been for my Daley Thompson
They're gonna bring Steve Ovett in for the closing ceremony to smack Coe with a bat
Distance in between are further apart. Eh?
Have you seen his legendary Youtube clip?
Oh, the Russian Billy Bonds is this guy: I love him even more now
No need to apologise. It's just that my default position now is to assume that anybody in a Team GB vest is a world-beater...
Russian high-jump dude has AWESOME BILLY BONDS HAIR
Is Morgan still relevant? I've not noticed him WINNING ANY OLYMPIC MEDALS
There's clearly a massive appetite for British success. If Team GB start winning paralympic medals, the rest follows
I beg to differ. Tickets are gong like hotcakes. GB's awesome Olympic success will give a massive boost to the paralympics.
When paralympians win gold. Not if.
RT Meny inception (keep moving your cursor around the left edge)
So we're gonna win the discus tonight, right? And the high jump? I'm now just assuming that everyone on is a world-beater

Not only Grandstand, Sportsnight. Sportsnight was awesome.
I think these rowers on BBC1 right now might be pissed
His first teamsheet when he managed Forest apparently contained 11 outfield players and no GK. Is that an achievement?
Normally when we lose on penalties, it makes me thoroughly miserable. Today, not so much :)

Please tell me they're not going to put Michael Johnson in with Lineker. Because I think Johnson will thump him. On second thoughts...

How much do you score for sacrificing a child?
Flickr used to be my favourite place on the Interwebs (around 2006/7). But everything Y! touches turns to shit.

Some people, when confronted with a problem, think I know, I'll use gemsets. And now bundler has disappeared from their path.

Inclusion of Ox undoubtedly exciting, but recall Walcott's holiday in Germany in 2006. Expect to see bland 4-4-2 rubbish.
Squad choices are weak, insipid, mediocre. Maybe Woy thinks he's managing Villa.
Those are the best 4 centre forwards in England? Really?

Awesomeness has arrived
joeybarton (a): old English word meaning no idea of when to shut the fuck up
Mediocre. That's the word.
Yes, but Terry Connor thought he was applying to manage a Sunday morning team and was baffled to find himself in the Prem
Regardless of relegations, are Aston Villa this season's most hopeless, uninspiring, wet, feckless, feeble Prem team? Discuss...
Shearer says With expectations lowered, maybe we can win it. Um, isn't that raising expectations?
Terry Connor still looks utterly bewildered, like he has no idea how he got that job.
Has the West Brom goalkeeper ever played football at all before today?
Joey Barton really is a vile little ratbag, isn't he?

It's not raining. Maybe we can see the puffins today...
Watching the swallows feeding outside the cottage. Swallows are awesome.
The rain has abated. I can see a tiny bit of blue sky over the sea to the south. Maybe tomorrow will be better...

Wouldn't a follow-on decision be influenced by the weather? Bat if sunny, bowl if cloudy?
We have them at 156-8 (they took the light at 18:30-ish), they need 70 more to save the follow-on. We can crush them here :)

Have faith, young apprentice. Flintoff will get a five-for, Broad will shake them up with some nasty short stuff.
Come on England, remember how you roughed them up here 4 years ago. Langer's elbow, Ponting's cheek #theashes
Fred has the new ball. Yay! #theashes
you want twidroid for your phone, and the twitter application for Facebook
Harmison blows hot (see 2005) and cold (2006/7). They don't trust him. Broad is the future, apparently. Bring Hoggard back!

Cricket is the greatest sport ever devised. Nothing compares to a summer afternoon listening to the Test Match on the radio. FACT.
It's all so familiar... #theashes
both sides seem to have dispensed with a goalkeeper, too. Seems a schoolboy error to me.
Gotta be pleased with 255-2 at tea. We can bat them out of this, as long as our bowlers can get a bit of life out of this pitch #theashes
Hats off to Alastair Cook #theashes
is thinking of Edgbaston 2005. Ponting probably is, too #theashes
He couldn't hit a barn from the inside, apparently. Sorely missing one G. McGarth, I think...
You know he tweets now?

England to make 350+, Anderson and Broad to do some real damage after lunch. Remember Harmison at Lord's 2005! #theashes
hopes that Anderson and Broad are watching videos of Harmison roughing up the Australians on the first day at Lord's in 2005 #theashes
This is looking a lot better. And England's spinners must be rubbing their hands together. #theashes

Anyway, drop Harry Kane #euro2020
(I'm not going to comment here on whether Terry should ever have been anywhere being England Captain, except to say Of Course He Fucking Shouldn't)
But it has lead to fuckery like Capello quitting when the FA decided John Terry could no longer be the Captain
In Beckham's case this was all OK because he was already a Public Figure, and being appointed Captain arguably made him a better player in an England shirt
This made Beckham the first name in any squad, and on any teamsheet
But that changed with Eriksson and Beckham - now the England Captain had become a Public Figure, a position independent of any particular squad or competition
Like before that, the manager would have a preferred captain in mind and would give him the armband, but it didn't really matter
Is it just me misremembering, or was Being England Captain never such a big deal until Eriksson anointed David Beckham?
Hey man how's the divorce going?
Would broadcasters around Europe have been hyping that as one of the Games Of Tournament or was it just the tragically parochial British media? #EURO2020
Good choice

They would have nuked it anyway, when they couldn't be arsed with if anymore. It's what they do

Yeah, you just shifted the goalposts, well done. The jpeg or the mp3 or the fake real-estate or whatever is a string of bits, which is infinitely reproducible. The fact that you paid somebody for a magic bean which says I own this string of bits does not change that fact
It's a string of bits
Gets worse every time you hear it
It does make it infinitely reproducible at essentially zero marginal cost, though
Amazing

An NFT is a number which points to a jpeg and somehow asserts ownership of the jpeg. But the jpeg is still just a jpeg, in all of its infinitely-reproducible glory. What has the NFT bought me, exactly?

And then Apologize for this situation, we have a great news for you, your order will be delivered to you tomorrow by the end of the day! Have a great day!
By yesterday, it was 30 days since the order was placed, so I pinged them again and asked for a refund, and I got Please allow us time for this week to do the needful if not then we will do the refund for you. Will that work for you ?
Alarm bells were ringing, tbh
There has been a miscommunication with the supplier end and some of the products were assigned wrong tracking numbers. You will be getting a new tracking number within this week only and you will receive your order soon now.
When I next checked the tracking link, on May 1st, it said the parcel had been delivered on April 30th. I expect it will come as no surprise to learn that it had not, in fact, been delivered So I contacted them and told them this, and after my third email, I got
10 days later I got a shipping notification with a tracking link on indicating that the parcel was indeed coming from China
The next email I received informed me that the standard delivery time is 8-12 Business days OK fine, this is some drop-shipping thing, whatever, I'm in no rush
The acknowledgement email came from no-reply@my.store-emails.com, thanking me for my order from T-Force Retail, but whatever
