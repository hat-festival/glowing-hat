![The hat, working for the first time](/emf-2024/videos/first-hat.gif)

Notes:

This is a gif of the first time I got the hat working after partially mapping the lights, which was very exciting. Like, I thought I'd done it all correctly, but to see it actually doing this was mind-blowing.

So now we need some interesting ways to light up the hat. I initially had lots of elaborate ideas, but few of them looked like I had imagined them once they were translated to the hat, often because the resolution is hilariously low. It did however generate a few gems, and it's easy and fun to iterate on ideas.
