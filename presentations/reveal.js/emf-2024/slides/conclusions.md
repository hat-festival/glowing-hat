# What have we learned?

Notes:

You should totally do something like this because before I started, I knew very little about any of this stuff, and now I have Opinions about many new things. This is the most Programming Purely For The Art Of It thing that I've done in a while, and if that's not in the spirit of EMF, I don't know what is.

Also check carefully before you glue your pixels down, and maybe don't buy the cheapest USB microphone on eBay.
