## Turning sound into light

Notes:

I attached a USB microphone to it and attempted to implement Fast Fourier Transforms. I had presumed that if I pretended to understand FFTs for long enough, that eventually I would, but it didn't work out. As you can see, it does respond to sound, but not in any sort of reliable way. In my head, I had imagined it basically jumping up and down to the sound of a kick drum, but it just does this. This might be because I bought a very cheap USB mic, but I think it's more likely that I've badly half-assed my FFT implementation. If anybody has any insights or experience with this, and wants to help me hack on some terrible Python, please come and find me afterwards.
