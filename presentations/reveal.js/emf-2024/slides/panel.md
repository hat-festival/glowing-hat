## When all you have is a hat...

Notes:

A Hat is just an array of pixels - the fact that it's wrapped around a hat is kind of incidental, which means it's isomorphic to lots of other NeoPixel things, and for many of these things it's much easier to establish the positions of each light. So I've had the same code running on these flat LED panels.
