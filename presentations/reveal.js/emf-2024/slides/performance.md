## Making it fast enough

Notes:

The photo on the left is the Pi Zero 1 that originally ran the hat, in 2022. On the right is the Zero 2 that's running it now. They might look identical, but the performance difference is *vast*, but even this isn't enough for some of what I want to do.

In my day job, I'm an infrastructure engineer. This mostly means that any code I write just has to do the right thing, but for the hat, it has to do the right thing *and* do it fast enough. And we can't scale a Pi by giving more money to AWS.
