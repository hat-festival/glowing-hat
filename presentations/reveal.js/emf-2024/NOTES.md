* Sound to light - picture of Dazzler
  * I had assumed that if I pretended to understand FFTs for long enough, eventually I would

* Doing it for the art of the thing

* EMF as Scope Creep

* Normally my code just has to work
  * Now it has to work fast
  * We cannot scale by giving money to AWS

* RGB default for NeoPixels
  * But HSV is more intuitive and maths-friendly
  * RGB as late as possible, as a compiled artefact

* Modes
  * You have to try it on the hat
  * It often doesn't look like you imagined it
    * Due to shitty resolution
    * But it can deliver some gems

* What's in here
  * ~Redis~ ValKey
  * OpenCV

* Also this maps to other things
  * Behold, a Hat

Be aware that I understood very little of this before I started, and there are almost certainly better ways to do everything here

* You have to hack on the hat
  * If it looks like you imagined, then you can go back and structure and test the code
    * And build some underlying APIs
  * Often it doesn't work
    * But it throws up some gems

* The NeoPixels default to RGB
  * Show demo code
  * But it's more intuitive (and easier to math) with HSV
  * Go to RGB as late as possible, like a compiled artefact

* Zero v Zero 2

* My code just has to work, now it has to perform

Please understand that I knew pretty much nothing about any of this before I started, and there are almost certainly better ways to do this kind of thing, but it all worked
