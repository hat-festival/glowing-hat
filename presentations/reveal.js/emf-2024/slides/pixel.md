## Pixel metadata

```python
{
  "index": 10,
  "x": -0.016029593094944512,
  "y": -0.3249075215782984,
  "z": 0.5043156596794082,
  "angles": {
    "x": 122.79183214885639,
    "y": 358.1794756662044,
    "z": 267.17555335782856,
  },
}
```

Notes:

So each pixel is represented by some nice metadata like this. We can also work out the angle of each pixel in each of the x, y and z planes, using some half-remembered trigonometry.
