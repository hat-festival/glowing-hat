## Mapping the lights

Notes:

So this is where the interesting stuff starts: first you need some method of mounting the hat and the camera a fixed distance apart and square-on to each other. Did I use Lego? Of course I used Lego.

Once you've got everything securely mounted, in a reasonably dark room, you just run a script that lights the pixels, one at a time, and takes a photo. Once you've got your 100 photos from the front, you turn the hat through 90 degrees, and take 100 more photos. And then again, and again, for all four sides.
